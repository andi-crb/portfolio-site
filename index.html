         <div class="namefinder">
             <p>The Name Finder was my first javascript project, and I’m including it here both because it gives a sense of how far I’ve come, but also because it gave me a huge sense of accomplishment to have built something from the start and have it working and usable.</p>
             <p>When I’m not coding, I’m writing fiction. Names for major characters can be agonised over and researched in depth, but sometimes you just need a name for a minor character who’s mentioned in passing. My idea was to create a generator for characters from New Zealand where, if you entered a year and gender, you would be given a common name for people born in that year.</p>
             <p>I obtained the intial data from the Department of Internal Affairs website and ordered it into arrays marked by year and gender. I then wrote code that took the inputted values and used them to select a name at random from the hundred that met each criterion.</p>
             <p>I knew when I created the project that having all the data client side wasn’t good practice, but at that point I didn’t have the skills to do anything else. A few weeks later, I reworked it, using REST and storing the data in a serverside JSON file. I also wrote a small script to automate part of the reformatting of the data into JSON format.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="skill-bank">
             <p>long with two classmates, I built Skill Bank in week four of Enspiral Dev Academy bootcamp. In every community or workplace, there are a range of skills. Some may be obvious parts of a role and listed in a CV or job description, but others are less clear and not those you may think are important... until the one thing you urgently need is someone who speaks Khmer or has local knowledge of Berlin's suburbs.</p>
             <p>We built Skill Bank as an app that allowed people to add their skills and to search for others with the ability or knowledge they needed. We decided to focus on three categories: languages, technical skills, and areas of the world - but this of course has potential for expansion.</p>
             <p>As we had just one day to complete the project, we did not arrive at a fully functional app. However this was a great opportunity to practice and build on what we had learned about REST APIs.</p>
